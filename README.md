# Library Manager - Treehouse - SQL

> project 10 of Treehouse Web Development Tech Degree

Constructed an application that allows pages to list, add, update, and delete books while implementing a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This project provided a great opportunity to start familiarizing myself with implementing and utilizing a database for data persistence and leveraging helpful database-related tools to view and interact with a database.

The information for a given book is comprised of:

- Book's name
- Book's author
- Book's genre
- Book's realease year

1. Data Paggination
